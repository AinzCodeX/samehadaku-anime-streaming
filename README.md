# Samehadaku - Nonton Streaming Anime Sub Indo

## Project Overview
Samehadaku is a web application that allows users to stream anime with Indonesian subtitles. The platform features a sleek and responsive layout thanks to Tailwind CSS, and provides users with access to the latest anime episodes and a top 10 anime ranking section. The app is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, ensuring an enjoyable anime-watching experience.

## Installation
To run Samehadaku locally, you'll need to set up a web server. Here's how you can do that:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd samehadaku
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser:**
   Alternatively, if you have a local server like Apache or a simple HTTP server via Python, you can serve the application.

   For example, to use Python's built-in server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view the application.

## Usage
- Type the name of an anime in the search bar at the top of the page to find specific titles.
- Browse through the Top 10 anime of the week and the latest anime releases.
- Click on the "Load More Anime" button to simulate loading additional anime entries.

## Features
